# 🧭 Triplet Trust Protocol: Project Board

This repository is organized around directional workflows for public trustpoint verification — not brand-building.

> **TTP is not a mystery, not a product, not a movement.**  
> It’s a structure for memory: sent, not shipped.

This board helps track:

| Zone      | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `.org`    | Verifiable reports (e.g. Sachs2023, TTP-001)     |
| `.net`    | General development and decentralized publishing |
| `.com`    | Style/dissonance classification, collapse avoidance |

Each report (e.g. Sachs2023) reflects bilateral trust logic using structured `.json` and `.md` formats.

## 🧬 Start Here

- 📘 `reports/sachs2023.md` → Public trustpoint summary  
- 📂 `people/*.json` → Authorship mapping and DID-ready fields  
- 📚 `lexicon/*.json` → Definitions for terms like `personhood`, `photon`, `re-left`  
- 🧠 `claims.json` → Collapse tracking and resonant counterclaims  

---

## 🚦 Want to Contribute?

You can fork or verify any of these:
- A trustpoint report (`/reports/*.json`)
- A lexicon entry (`/lexicon/*.json`)
- A translation or language refinement (`/expression/`)

The only rule is: **don’t collapse.**
