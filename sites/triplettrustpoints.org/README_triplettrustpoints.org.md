# 🌍 Triplet Trustpoints

**Triplet Trustpoints** is part of the [Triplet Trust Protocol](https://triplettrustprotocol.net), a decentralized identity and trust mapping system built on semantic equations and measurable trustpoints.

## 📐 Purpose

Triplet Trustpoints is the public interface of the Triplet Trust Protocol. It provides a decentralized, multilingual architecture for sharing, verifying, and linking trustpoints across federated systems like the UN, BlueSky, and sustainable Earth organizations.

## 🔢 Trust Equations

- Primary equation: `(1 + 1) + 1 ≠ -1`
- This equation encodes GOS ≠ ZOS ≠ VOS.
- Live API: [`/api/equation.json`](./api/equation.json)
