# Sister Pi: 1+1 ≠ –1; 1π + 1π = 2π

[SisterPi.com](https://sisterpi.com) points to [SisterPi.net](https://sisterpi.net),  
which identifies the public clarity platform *(religion & biology)*  
for social media like GERM Network and BlueSky:  
**obvious lie detection between all 1+1 sources of thought.**

We evaluate interpersonal and international claims  
using science’s trust equations, **timestamped, now**:  
**1 + 1 + 1 = 🚦**
