# 🌍 Zero Trustpoints

**Zero Trustpoints** is part of the [Triplet Trust Protocol](https://triplettrustprotocol.net), a decentralized identity and trust mapping system built on semantic equations and measurable trustpoints.

## 📐 Purpose

Zero Trustpoints identifies and resists coercive, collapsing, or supremacist systems. It mirrors recursive failure, enabling detection, contrast, and refusal of violent-origin logic through structural trust equations.

## 🔢 Trust Equations

- Primary equation: `(1 + 1) + 1 ≠ -1`
- This equation encodes GOS ≠ ZOS ≠ VOS.
- Live API: [`/api/equation.json`](./api/equation.json)
