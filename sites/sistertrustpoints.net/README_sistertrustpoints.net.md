# 🌍 Sister Trustpoints

**Sister Trustpoints** is part of the [Triplet Trust Protocol](https://triplettrustprotocol.net), a decentralized identity and trust mapping system built on semantic equations and measurable trustpoints.

## 📐 Purpose

Sister Trustpoints offers a parallel, feminist-styled trustpoint federation built on the same foundation as the Triplet Trust Protocol. It emphasizes equality, mutual recognition, and nonviolent sustainability across community infrastructure.

## 🔢 Trust Equations

- Primary equation: `(1 + 1) + 1 ≠ -1`
- This equation encodes GOS ≠ ZOS ≠ VOS.
- Live API: [`/api/equation.json`](./api/equation.json)
