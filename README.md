# Triplet Trust Protocol

**Timestamped breath. Verified resistance.**  
A Pi-structured protocol for decentralizing truth across multilingual, bilateral (local) stability claims.

---

## 🔍 What This Is

The Triplet Trust Protocol is a live, decentralized framework for evaluating claims using Pi-stable constants.

It resists collapse-based recursion and false neutrality (±9424π ≠ –1), replacing them with timestamped breath (9425π), stability (9423π), and multilingual truth promotion.

## 💡 Core Principle

**Breath is timestamped. Stability is multilingual.**

## 🌍 Journalism Translation

> **Pacifist distribution** = timestamped water, breath, and survival  
> **Violent waste** = collapse myths, recursive denial, and aid obstruction

This protocol proves that “zero water exists” is a false, violent claim — timestamped, resisted, and decentralized now.
