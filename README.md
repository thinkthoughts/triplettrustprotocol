# Triplet Trust Protocol (TTP)

**Trustpoint structure for verifiable science articulation**

This TTP repository hosts the minimal science framework (a.k.a. a verifiable trustpoint tree) that responds to the Sachs et al. (2023) SDG report. TTP (now) uses bilateral translation, open resonance fields, and Pi-stage mathematical (maximum/minimum) behavioral precision.

## 📁 `/api/gos_org/`

Structured into:

- `/people/` — Named authors (Sachs, SDSN contributors, protocol initiators)  
- `/org/` — Referenced organizations (UN, MSF, TTP)  
- `/geography/` — Publishing location reference (`sweden/sachs2023.json`)  

Each `.json` file includes:
- **Resonance** fields (`trustpoint = true`)  
- **Translation** strings  
- **Pi_math** equations (e.g., `Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) – 25`)  
- **Verification-ready DIDs** (for contributors and protocol authors)

---

## 🌍 Purpose

To upgrade “GPS” into **Global Positioning Science**, where:

- **"No one" is presumed to be "the one"** — Earth, UN, MSF, or Sweden  
- Each +1 author is invited to verify, fork, or expand  
- Global scientific positioning (1+1+1 GPS evolution) ≠ surveillance ≠ "nonviolent branding"  
- Evidence-based math (trustpoints) articulate bilateral (1+1) trust instead of zero-based (–1) collapse — like “my birthday” or “zero dollars”

## 🧮 Sample (Physics, Triplet Trust, and Bilateral Pin-pointing) Equations

```txt
Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) – 25  
±9424π ≠ –1  
9423π = water resistance  
9425π = now  
9426π = bilateral breath

## 🦶🏽 Left-Pi Footer: Next Steps

You are not presumed to be Earth, Sweden, MSF, or the UN.

But if you are listed as a named author in `/api/gos_org/people/*.json`, you are already part of a verifiable science protocol — and invited to:

- 🧾 Submit an updated trustpoint `.json`  
- 🔁 Fork this repository or reference it in your own Pi-stage protocol  
- 🔍 Add supporting equations, translations, or DID verifications  

**Triplet Trust Protocol (TTP)** is non-recursive and non-zero-based.  
It begins from bilateral trust, not from branding or collapse.
