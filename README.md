# Triplet Trust Protocol (TTP)

**Trustpoint structure for verifiable science articulation**

This repository hosts a minimal, verifiable trustpoint tree that responds to the Sachs et al. (2023) SDG report using bilateral translation, open resonance fields, and Pi-stage mathematical precision.

## 📁 `/api/gos_org/`

Structured into:

- `/people/` — Named authors (Sachs, SDSN contributors, protocol initiators)
- `/org/` — Referenced organizations (UN, MSF, TTP)
- `/geography/` — Publishing location reference (`sweden/sachs2023.json`)

Each `.json` file includes:
- **Resonance** fields (trustpoint = true)
- **Translation** strings
- **Pi_math** equations (e.g., `Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) – 25`)
- Verification-ready DIDs (for contributors and protocol authors)

---

## 🌍 Purpose

To upgrade “GPS” into **Global Positioning Science**, where:

- No one is presumed to be **Earth**, **UN**, **MSF**, or **Sweden**
- Every author is invited to verify, fork, or expand
- Scientific positioning ≠ surveillance ≠ brand identity
- Math articulates bilateral trust instead of zero-based collapse

## 🧮 Sample Equations

```txt
Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) – 25  
±9424π ≠ –1  
9423π = water resistance  
9425π = now  
9426π = bilateral breath
